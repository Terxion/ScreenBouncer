### Simple python script that bounces a png around your screen
- You can change the png for anything you want, as long as it's named "ball.png"
- Only works on windows
- Only way to turn it off is by killing it in task manager
- Kinda annoying
- You can change the speed of the png by modifying the sx and sy variable
- You can change the size of the png by modifying the r variable
- You'll need these libraries:
```
Pillow
tkinter
PyWin32
```
